Starting a huge project like this one, was not easy. None of the group members
had made a system like this before, so we did a lot of reading and investigation
before we could start the coding. By parsing the Legemiddelh√•ndboka HTML files
and the ontologies, and then create java object was a great way of making
abstracting all the parsing from the rest of the system. We used Lucene for
making indexing, searching and scoring. Lucene was easy and quick to use. Even
though our results was not the best, we have thought of many improvement we
would have tried out if we was going to continue working on the system.
