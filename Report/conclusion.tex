\chapter{Conclusion} \label{cha:conclusion}

Starting a huge project like this one, was not easy; we had to investigate a lot
to look for different APIs.  For the OWL file parser, we first tried to use the
protege API because we are familiarized with the protege program. We spent a lot
of time trying to understand how this API works, and we also considered the
possibility of developing a XML parser and converting the OWL file to XML with
protege. However, we finally used the OWL API. The API was very simple and
obtained satisfactory results.\\

For the search engine we used Lucene because has very good reviews and plenty of
tutorials. In conclusion, adding a basic search engine for a set of documents
is easy, but making an accurate and efficient mechanism search takes a lot of
time and effort.
